#### **08.08.2021, [Harmful Bodies](https://theaternatur-harz.de/veranstaltung/gefaehrliche-koerper/), Theaternatur Festival, Waldbühne Benneckenstein, DE**
:   The duo *Frisch&Schick* ([Johannes Frick](https://www.instagram.com/jon_darc/) & Jasmin Schädler) presented an excerpt of their work Harmful Bodies - a promiscuous concert performance in cooperation with media artist Timo Kleinemeier and with costumes by designer [Aziz Rebar](https://www.instagram.com/aziz_rebar/) – for the first time in an analog version in the proximity of the forest bar at Theaternatur Festival. 
Harm emanates from our bodies, an awareness that has finally emerged in the last year. The artists devote themselves to love and promiscuity with emphasis on the physical harm. Since the discovery of the HI-Virus, this subject has been undergoing a social overhaul. From the fear of a death sentence at the time to today's classification of a chronic illness, the team encounters the history of a virus that knows no morals, but which has been and continues to be confronted in a moralizing and stigmatizing manner.
The audience is invited to a performative and musical journey that assumes different perspectives and aesthetic forms.
