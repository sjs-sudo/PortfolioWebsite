#### **31.12.2021, [How to be a better Machine](https://howtobeabettermachine.hotglue.me/), MWK Stipendium, Stuttgart** 
: Did you ever think it would be easier to be a machine? 
Did you ever pretend to be a machine to be forgiven?

: The website is an interactive web training to help the users on their way to becoming a better machine. It is an inversion of the omnipresent 
anthropomorphization of machines.

#### **30.12.2021, Phasen der Rührung, [die apokalyptischen tänzerin\*nen](https://www.apocalypse.dance/projekte/phasen-der-ruehrung), Stuttgart, DE**

:   The *Institut für analytische Aufführungspraxis* (Institute for Analytical Performance Practice), IAAP in short, cordially invited for the annual 
general meeting.
Together we were cooking, eating and talking about the act of spectating. What did we all spectate this year? How were we welcomed in the theater? 
What touched us, what was touched and where would we have liked to stir a little? Which experiences do we want to forget again and which audience situation worked best? 
Our goal is to reflect together on how we perceive ourselves as the audience in the theater, what expectations we have of the theater and what it means to be the audience: because without—no theater. 
Together with selected guests (the cultural journalist and theater critic [Petra Mostbacher-Dix](http://sur-kultur.net/) and the performance artist [Arthur Romanowski](https://www.schauspielhaus.at/rote_beete_reden)) 
and underpinned by initial conclusions from our study on spectating, we talked about spectating, experiencing. 
And how better to do that than by stirring together a soup and then eating it? Home-cooked, warm, not too hot. 
Just the thing after those heavy holiday meals.

#### **21.12.2021, vom Aufgang der Sonne, [Künstlerhaus](https://kuenstlerhaus.de/), Stuttgart, DE**
:   *vom Aufgang der Sonne* was created as a response to the 250th anniversary of Hegel’s birthday in 2020. n.n.n. *collective* (Susanne Brendel, Julia Schäfer, Jasmin Schädler) used this opportunity to take a critical look at Hegel and his Philosophy Of History. The publication focuses on perspectives that have been overwritten or made invisible by Hegel and his legacy. 

Therefore, the Haitian Revolution is given a lot of space, in the form of an edited transcript of the symposium Mit Haiti an der Hegel Bar. For this event, which took place in May 2020, we invited Dr. Vanessa E. Thompson, Matti Traußneck und Dr. Jeanette Ehrmann. Furthermore the publication contains a conversation with geographer and artist [Dr. Sasha Engelmann](https://www.instagram.com/sasha_intheair/) in which we question the politicization of cardinal compass directions and cartography. In addition, scattered throughout the publication are exhibition views of an exhibition at the project space of @kunstvereinwagenhalle in November 2020 that had to stay closed due to the second lockdown. 

Moreover, the format of the publication challenges conventions of temporal linearity in terms of design as well as a specially developed literature map. The intricate design of the publication was developed and executed by @humbase
vom Aufgang der Sonne is published bilingually in Englisch and German.

On December 21, 2021 the publication will be presented to the public and can also be purchased. For this occasion we are opening our studio from 4pm - 9pm Künstlerhaus Stuttgart (Reuchlinstraße 4B, 3rd floor). At Künstlerhaus the 2G+ rule applies.
Online sales will be available from January 2022. Until then, the publication (17,00€) can also be ordered via collective.n.n.n@gmail.com.

#### **02.11.2021, [Algorithma - Your health and healing Algorithm](https://culturadecasa.ro/homefest-2021/), HomeFest 2021, Bucharest, ROU** 
:   Do you remember Eliza the chatbot? The least judgemental therapist ever.
Its creator Joseph Weizenbaum once wrote: “I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.” As the myth goes, his secretary asked him to leave the room so she could privately speak with Eliza. Algorithma is an updated version of Eliza. But Algorithma does not only function as a therapist but as a general health adviser with a focus on healing. Algorithma was fed with millions of health advice videos from Youtube that allows it to always propose an unexpected solution to its patients, even if they don’t ask for it. Once let loose for an advice session Algorithma becomes unstoppable and dives deep into the pool of health and healing click-baits. Meet Algorithma and be ready to get delusional.

#### **04.10.2021, [XCHANGES Xhoch1](https://schwankhalle.de/xhoch1), Bremen, DE** 
:   X-Changes is a newly founded event series for contemporary music, sound art, performance and adjoining disciplines. Young artists from the independent scenes in Bremen and Stuttgart are invited to organize evenings in the respective other city to present themselves and make connections. The series grasps itself as a platform for a generation of artists seeking alternatives to the established art business and to create the space for realizing their ideas and projects on their own. For this purpose, X-Changes seeks to be a free space for experimentation and simultaneously contribute to the creation of long-term connections and working structures

#### **26. & 29.09.2021, [Stuttgart witch trail. A performative journey to old and new motives of the witch.](https://stuttgarterhexenweg.eventbrite.de), Stuttgart, DE** 
:   In the term witch, historical phantasms and current tendencies encounter each other. Together we trace the history of witches and search for their potential for resistance. We will look at different adaptations of the image of the witch, also with regard to the extent to which they repeat questionable stereotypes. At distinctive places in the city, we get to know female actors who have found their own approaches to the subject and put them up for discussion. Thus, scientific, pop-cultural and practical approaches come together on this journey of discovery and direct our gaze to a multifaceted and imaginative perspective on witches.

#### **10.-13. & 16.-19.09.2021, [Kinder der Olypme – Fanshop](https://theaterhausg7.cortex-tickets.de/), Mannheim, DE** 
:   A fanshop in Mannheim: you are greeted by a woman, a saleswoman. She initiates a conversation, leads you through the shop, advertises her products. Every item tells a story. The woman's name is Olympe. Olympe is more than an employee: Olympe is an athlete, Olympe sprints, is a refugee. Olympe is a brand. Alternating between self and other, she embodies various narratives that imprison her in her place of worship or bring her freedom. 

[Langenfelder](http://www.langenfelder.de/content/langenfelder_lichtenberg.html) & [Lichtenberg](https://sophielichtenberg.de/) stage FANSHOP, a recorded, immersive spatial installation in urban space. The focus is on the question of access and intervention possibilities of a totalitarian state in and on the private reproductive body. The focus of the preceding long-term research was the exemplary examination of the myth of pregnancy doping. This myth states that female athletes in the past entered competitions pregnant in order to improve their performance. In collaboration with associated artists, the duo pursues this myth further in a fictional thought experiment, examining it in the field of tension between subjugation and self-empowerment and placing it alongside the biographical narrative of an escape. Both stories are united by the protagonists' striving for freedom and a pregnancy.

#### **08.08.2021, [Harmful Bodies](https://theaternatur-harz.de/veranstaltung/gefaehrliche-koerper/), Theaternatur Festival, Waldbühne Benneckenstein, DE**
:   The duo *Frisch&Schick* ([Johannes Frick](https://www.instagram.com/jon_darc/) & Jasmin Schädler) presented an excerpt of their work Harmful Bodies - a promiscuous concert performance in cooperation with media artist Timo Kleinemeier and with costumes by designer [Aziz Rebar](https://www.instagram.com/aziz_rebar/) – for the first time in an analog version in the proximity of the forest bar at Theaternatur Festival. 
Harm emanates from our bodies, an awareness that has finally emerged in the last year. The artists devote themselves to love and promiscuity with emphasis on the physical harm. Since the discovery of the HI-Virus, this subject has been undergoing a social overhaul. From the fear of a death sentence at the time to today's classification of a chronic illness, the team encounters the history of a virus that knows no morals, but which has been and continues to be confronted in a moralizing and stigmatizing manner.
The audience is invited to a performative and musical journey that assumes different perspectives and aesthetic forms.
