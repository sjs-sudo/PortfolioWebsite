#### **10.-13. & 16.-19.09.2021, [Kinder der Olypme – Fanshop](https://theaterhausg7.cortex-tickets.de/), Mannheim, DE** 
:   A fanshop in Mannheim: you are greeted by a woman, a saleswoman. She initiates a conversation, leads you through the shop, advertises her products. Every item tells a story. The woman's name is Olympe. Olympe is more than an employee: Olympe is an athlete, Olympe sprints, is a refugee. Olympe is a brand. Alternating between self and other, she embodies various narratives that imprison her in her place of worship or bring her freedom. 

[Langenfelder](http://www.langenfelder.de/content/langenfelder_lichtenberg.html) & [Lichtenberg](https://sophielichtenberg.de/) stage FANSHOP, a recorded, immersive spatial installation in urban space. The focus is on the question of access and intervention possibilities of a totalitarian state in and on the private reproductive body. The focus of the preceding long-term research was the exemplary examination of the myth of pregnancy doping. This myth states that female athletes in the past entered competitions pregnant in order to improve their performance. In collaboration with associated artists, the duo pursues this myth further in a fictional thought experiment, examining it in the field of tension between subjugation and self-empowerment and placing it alongside the biographical narrative of an escape. Both stories are united by the protagonists' striving for freedom and a pregnancy.

#### **08.08.2021, [Harmful Bodies](https://theaternatur-harz.de/veranstaltung/gefaehrliche-koerper/), Theaternatur Festival, Waldbühne Benneckenstein, DE**
:   The duo *Frisch&Schick* ([Johannes Frick](https://www.instagram.com/jon_darc/) & Jasmin Schädler) presented an excerpt of their work Harmful Bodies - a promiscuous concert performance in cooperation with media artist Timo Kleinemeier and with costumes by designer [Aziz Rebar](https://www.instagram.com/aziz_rebar/) – for the first time in an analog version in the proximity of the forest bar at Theaternatur Festival. 
Harm emanates from our bodies, an awareness that has finally emerged in the last year. The artists devote themselves to love and promiscuity with emphasis on the physical harm. Since the discovery of the HI-Virus, this subject has been undergoing a social overhaul. From the fear of a death sentence at the time to today's classification of a chronic illness, the team encounters the history of a virus that knows no morals, but which has been and continues to be confronted in a moralizing and stigmatizing manner.
The audience is invited to a performative and musical journey that assumes different perspectives and aesthetic forms.
