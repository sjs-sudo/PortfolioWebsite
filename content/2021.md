#### **05.05.2021, [Harmful Bodies](https://theaterrampe.de/stuecke/gefaehrliche-koerper/), Thetaer Rampe Stream, Stuttgart, DE**
:   The duo *Frisch&Schick* ([Johannes Frick](https://www.instagram.com/jon_darc/) & Jasmin Schädler) presents the work Harmful Bodies - a promiscuous concert performance in cooperation with designer [Aziz Rebar](https://www.instagram.com/aziz_rebar/), media artist Timo Kleinemeier as well as make-up by [Luna Legend](https://www.instagram.com/luna.legend/), and guest appearances by [Karimael Buledi](https://www.instagram.com/kari.m.ael/), Helena Dadakou, [Sebastiano Sing](https://sebastianosing.com/bio) and [Robyn/Hugo Le Brigand](https://www.hugolebrigand.com/). 
Harm emanates from our bodies, an awareness that has finally emerged in the last year. The artists devote themselves to love and promiscuity with emphasis on the physical harm. Since the discovery of the HI-Virus, this subject has been undergoing a social overhaul. From the fear of a death sentence at the time to today's classification of a chronic illness, the team encounters the history of a virus that knows no morals, but which has been and continues to be confronted in a moralizing and stigmatizing manner.
The audience is invited to a performative and musical journey that assumes different perspectives and aesthetic forms.
