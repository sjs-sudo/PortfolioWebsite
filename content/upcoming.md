# What's happening?

#### **05.05.2021, [Harmful Bodies](https://theaterrampe.de/stuecke/gefaehrliche-koerper/), Thetaer Rampe Stream, Stuttgart, DE**
:   The duo *Frisch&Schick* ([Johannes Frick](https://www.instagram.com/jon_darc/) & Jasmin Schädler) presents the work Harmful Bodies - a promiscuous concert performance in cooperation with designer [Aziz Rebar](https://www.instagram.com/aziz_rebar/), media artist Timo Kleinemeier as well as make-up by [Luna Legend](https://www.instagram.com/luna.legend/), and guest appearances by [Karimael Buledi](https://www.instagram.com/kari.m.ael/), Helena Dadaku, [Sebastiano Sing](https://sebastianosing.com/bio) and [Robyn/Hugo Le Brigand](https://www.hugolebrigand.com/). 
Harm emanates from our bodies, an awareness that has finally emerged in the last year. The artists devote themselves to love and promiscuity with emphasis on the physical harm. Since the discovery of the HI-Virus, this subject has been undergoing a social overhaul. From the fear of a death sentence at the time to today's classification of a chronic illness, the team encounters the history of a virus that knows no morals, but which has been and continues to be confronted in a moralizing and stigmatizing manner.
The audience is invited to a performative and musical journey that assumes different perspectives and aesthetic forms.

#### **14.04.2021, [Banana Island](https://www.apocalypse.dance/projekte/banana-island),  [6 Tage Frei Festival](https://www.6tagefrei.de/programm2021/) / [Theater Rampe](https://theaterrampe.de/stuecke/banana-island/), Stuttgart, DE**
##### Postponed to 2022 due to COVID19.
:   *Banana Island* is a choreographic and performative investigation of the banana. As one of the most important and popular foods in the world, protagonist of colonial and neo-colonial crimes and racist and sexist attributions, and at the same time film star, comedian, art and political weapon, the banana is the bracket and center of the performance. As we slowly begin to peel, we expose the tension between pop culture and tyranny. We interrogate the glamorous appearance of the banana and contextualize the opposites united in it.
