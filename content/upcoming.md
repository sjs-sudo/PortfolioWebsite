# What's happening?

&nbsp;

#### **06.03.-08.03.2025, [Wilde Ökologie – performative Live-Radioplay](https://theaterrampe.de/event/wilde-oekologie/), Theater RAMPE, Stuttgart, DE.**

:   WILDE ÖKOLOGIE is a live radio play inspired by the comic “A small excerpt from Wild Ecology” by Alessandro Pignocchi. 

:   Autonomous anarchic tits, talking cows and traumatised fish meet in a former marketplace, discuss new ways of living together and try to make contact with the societies around them.

:   With WILDE ÖKOLOGIE, die apokalyptischen tänzerin*nen invite you on an excursion into a postponed future. A future in which the collapse of the political system and the climate have already been overcome and a new order is spreading. Speculative and driven by the question of what a different society, a different way of living together could look like, we hear birds discussing with lizards and the contaminated water brings a small group of emissaries on their way.
