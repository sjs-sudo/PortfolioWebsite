# What's happening?

&nbsp;

#### **21.12.2020, vom Aufgang der Sonne, [Künstlerhaus](https://kuenstlerhaus.de/), Stuttgart, DE**
:   *vom Aufgang der Sonne* was created as a response to the 250th anniversary of Hegel’s birthday in 2020. n.n.n. *collective* (Susanne Brendel, Julia Schäfer, Jasmin Schädler) used this opportunity to take a critical look at Hegel and his Philosophy Of History. The publication focuses on perspectives that have been overwritten or made invisible by Hegel and his legacy. 

Therefore, the Haitian Revolution is given a lot of space, in the form of an edited transcript of the symposium Mit Haiti an der Hegel Bar. For this event, which took place in May 2020, we invited Dr. Vanessa E. Thompson, Matti Traußneck und Dr. Jeanette Ehrmann. Furthermore the publication contains a conversation with geographer and artist [Sasha Engelmann](https://www.instagram.com/sasha_intheair/) in which we question the politicization of cardinal compass directions and cartography. In addition, scattered throughout the publication are exhibition views of an exhibition at the project space of @kunstvereinwagenhalle in November 2020 that had to stay closed due to the second lockdown. 

Moreover, the format of the publication challenges conventions of temporal linearity in terms of design as well as a specially developed literature map. The intricate design of the publication was developed and executed by @humbase
vom Aufgang der Sonne is published bilingually in Englisch and German.

On December 21, 2021 the publication will be presented to the public and can also be purchased. For this occasion we are opening our studio from 4pm - 9pm Künstlerhaus Stuttgart (Reuchlinstraße 4B, 3rd floor). At Künstlerhaus the 2G+ rule applies.
Online sales will be available from January 2022. Until then, the publication (17,00€) can also be ordered via collective.n.n.n@gmail.com.

#### **27.04.2022, [Banana Island](https://www.apocalypse.dance/projekte/banana-island),  [6 Tage Frei Festival](https://www.6tagefrei.de/programm2021/) / [Theater Rampe](https://theaterrampe.de/stuecke/banana-island/), Stuttgart, DE**
:   *Banana Island* is a choreographic and performative investigation of the banana. As one of the most important and popular foods in the world, protagonist of colonial and neo-colonial crimes and racist and sexist attributions, and at the same time film star, comedian, art and political weapon, the banana is the bracket and center of the performance. As we slowly begin to peel, we expose the tension between pop culture and tyranny. We interrogate the glamorous appearance of the banana and contextualize the opposites united in it.
