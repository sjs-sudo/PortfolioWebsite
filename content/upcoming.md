# What's happening?

&nbsp;

#### **30.12.2021, Phasen der Rührung, [die apokalyptischen tänzerin\*nen](https://www.apocalypse.dance/projekte/phasen-der-ruehrung), Stuttgart, DE**

:   The *Institut für analytische Aufführungspraxis* (Institute for Analytical Performance Practice), IAAP in short, cordially invites you to the annual general meeting on 30.12.21 at 7 pm. 
Together we will be cooking, eating and talking about the act of spectating. What did we all spectate this year? How were we welcomed in the theater? 
What touched us, what was touched and where would we have liked to stir a little? Which experiences do we want to forget again and which audience situation worked best? 
Our goal is to reflect together on how we perceive ourselves as the audience in the theater, what expectations we have of the theater and what it means to be the audience: because without—no theater. 
Together with selected guests (the cultural journalist and theater critic [Petra Mostbacher-Dix](http://sur-kultur.net/) and the performance artist [Arthur Romanowski](https://www.schauspielhaus.at/rote_beete_reden)) 
and underpinned by initial conclusions from our study on spectating, we will talk about spectating, experiencing. 
And how better to do that than by stirring together a soup and then eating it? Home-cooked, warm, not too hot. 
Just the thing after those heavy holiday meals.

#### **27.04.2022, [Banana Island](https://www.apocalypse.dance/projekte/banana-island),  [6 Tage Frei Festival](https://www.6tagefrei.de/programm2021/) / [Theater Rampe](https://theaterrampe.de/stuecke/banana-island/), Stuttgart, DE**
:   *Banana Island* is a choreographic and performative investigation of the banana. As one of the most important and popular foods in the world, protagonist of colonial and neo-colonial crimes and racist and sexist attributions, and at the same time film star, comedian, art and political weapon, the banana is the bracket and center of the performance. As we slowly begin to peel, we expose the tension between pop culture and tyranny. We interrogate the glamorous appearance of the banana and contextualize the opposites united in it.
