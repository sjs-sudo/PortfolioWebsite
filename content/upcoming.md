#### **03./04./05.12.2021, [Wunderland](https://www.apocalypse.dance/projekte/wunderland), Theater Rampe, Stuttgart, DE**

 wrote for the performance collective *die apokalyptischen tänzerin*nen*. Loosely based on Alice in Wonderland, the author invites the audience into a world where standards of good and evil are dissolved.

:   A project by [die apokalyptische tänzerin\*nen](https://www.apocalypse.dance/) and Produktionsbüro [schæfer&sœhne](http://www.ae-oe.de/).

&nbsp;
:   Funded by the *City of Stuttgart*, by the *Association of Independent Dance and Theatre Creators in Baden-Württemberg* through means of the *State Ministry of Baden-Wuerttemberg for Sciences, Research and Arts* and by *Fonds Socioculture e.V.*

#### **16. & 17.12.2021, [Harmful Bodies](https://www.zeitraumexit.de/veranstaltung/gefaehrliche-koerper), zeitraumexit, Mannheim, DE**
:   The duo *Frisch&Schick* ([Johannes Frick](https://www.instagram.com/jon_darc/) & Jasmin Schädler) presented an excerpt of their work Harmful Bodies - a promiscuous concert performance in cooperation with media artist Timo Kleinemeier and with costumes by designer [Aziz Rebar](https://www.instagram.com/aziz_rebar/) – for the first time in an analog version in the proximity of the forest bar at Theaternatur Festival. 
Harm emanates from our bodies, an awareness that has finally emerged in the last year. The artists devote themselves to love and promiscuity with emphasis on the physical harm. Since the discovery of the HI-Virus, this subject has been undergoing a social overhaul. From the fear of a death sentence at the time to today's classification of a chronic illness, the team encounters the history of a virus that knows no morals, but which has been and continues to be confronted in a moralizing and stigmatizing manner.
The audience is invited to a performative and musical journey that assumes different perspectives and aesthetic forms.

:   *hands on aids* is a hybrid between party, concert, immersive theater performance and installation. In addition to the topic of HIV and AIDS prevention, Frisch & Schick deal with the history of the disease and its impact on the psyche within society since its discovery. 

&nbsp;

:   A project by *Frisch & Schick* ([Johannes Frick](https://johannesfrick.jimdofree.com/) and Jasmin Schädler) and [InterAKT Initiative e.V.](https://interakt-initiative.com/). With Sebastiano Sing & Robyn/Hugo Le Brigand, Karimael Buledi, Helena Dadoku and Jonas Wienberg.

#### **27.04.2022, [Banana Island](https://www.apocalypse.dance/projekte/banana-island),  [6 Tage Frei Festival](https://www.6tagefrei.de/programm2021/) / [Theater Rampe](https://theaterrampe.de/stuecke/banana-island/), Stuttgart, DE**
:   *Banana Island* is a choreographic and performative investigation of the banana. As one of the most important and popular foods in the world, protagonist of colonial and neo-colonial crimes and racist and sexist attributions, and at the same time film star, comedian, art and political weapon, the banana is the bracket and center of the performance. As we slowly begin to peel, we expose the tension between pop culture and tyranny. We interrogate the glamorous appearance of the banana and contextualize the opposites united in it.
