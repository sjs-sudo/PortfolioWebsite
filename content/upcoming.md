# What's happening?

&nbsp;

#### **26. & 29.09.2021, [Stuttgart witch trail. A performative journey to old and new motives of the witch.](https://stuttgarterhexenweg.eventbrite.de), Stuttgart, DE** 
:   In the term witch, historical phantasms and current tendencies encounter each other. Together we trace the history of witches and search for their potential for resistance. We will look at different adaptations of the image of the witch, also with regard to the extent to which they repeat questionable stereotypes. At distinctive places in the city, we get to know female actors who have found their own approaches to the subject and put them up for discussion. Thus, scientific, pop-cultural and practical approaches come together on this journey of discovery and direct our gaze to a multifaceted and imaginative perspective on witches.

#### **04.10.2021, [XCHANGES Xhoch1](https://schwankhalle.de/xhoch1), Bremen, DE** 
:   X-Changes is a newly founded event series for contemporary music, sound art, performance and adjoining disciplines. Young artists from the independent scenes in Bremen and Stuttgart are invited to organize evenings in the respective other city to present themselves and make connections. The series grasps itself as a platform for a generation of artists seeking alternatives to the established art business and to create the space for realizing their ideas and projects on their own. For this purpose, X-Changes seeks to be a free space for experimentation and simultaneously contribute to the creation of long-term connections and working structures

:   An event by Projektgruppe Neue Musik (PGNM).

#### **27.04.2022, [Banana Island](https://www.apocalypse.dance/projekte/banana-island),  [6 Tage Frei Festival](https://www.6tagefrei.de/programm2021/) / [Theater Rampe](https://theaterrampe.de/stuecke/banana-island/), Stuttgart, DE**
:   *Banana Island* is a choreographic and performative investigation of the banana. As one of the most important and popular foods in the world, protagonist of colonial and neo-colonial crimes and racist and sexist attributions, and at the same time film star, comedian, art and political weapon, the banana is the bracket and center of the performance. As we slowly begin to peel, we expose the tension between pop culture and tyranny. We interrogate the glamorous appearance of the banana and contextualize the opposites united in it.
