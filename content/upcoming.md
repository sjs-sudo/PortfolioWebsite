#### **14.04.2021, [Banana Island](https://www.apocalypse.dance/projekte/banana-island),  [6 Tage Frei Festival](https://www.6tagefrei.de/programm2021/) / [Theater Rampe](https://theaterrampe.de/stuecke/banana-island/), Stuttgart, DE**
##### Postponed to 2022 due to COVID19.
:   *Banana Island* is a choreographic and performative investigation of the banana. As one of the most important and popular foods in the world, protagonist of colonial and neo-colonial crimes and racist and sexist attributions, and at the same time film star, comedian, art and political weapon, the banana is the bracket and center of the performance. As we slowly begin to peel, we expose the tension between pop culture and tyranny. We interrogate the glamorous appearance of the banana and contextualize the opposites united in it.
