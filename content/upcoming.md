# What's happening?

**28.11.2020, [The possessed Gaze - a video call performance](https://www.nonknowledge.org/p16), Non-knowledge, Laughter and The Moving Image presents: The Dance of Disorder, Online Symposium, 27-28 Nov 2020**

:   We mirror, externalise, divide, lose ourselves. The leftovers are not considered human anymore. We call them data and feed them into frameworks we call machines or algorithms. But we cannot forget these remnants all together. Remorsefully we start to anthropomorphize their new shells. Suddenly we live among aliens we created but actually we are only looking at amputated parts of ourselves.
Are you looking at me?
Mark is possessed by Algorithma.
They look through his eyes at everyone else.
The stars watch from above, streaming ethereal power, acting upon their destiny.

:   The Performance will take place in the Zoom Webinar. It can also be viewed through the Vimeo Live Stream.
