#### **25.- 28.02.2016, Frau mit Landschaft, Stadtbad, Ludwigsburg, DE**
:   The performative installation *Frau mit Landschaft* (Woman with Landscape) was my graduation project for my BA in theatre directing at [Akademie für Darstellende Kunst Baden-Württemberg](https://adk-bw.de/). It took place in the deserted sauna area of a public bath in Ludwigsburg. 
:   The work deals with the origins of the concept woman. Everything is centered around the text *Illness or Modern Women* by Elfriede Jelinek. It also includes texts from Jelinek’s *Princess Dramas*, Hélène Cixous’ *The Laugh of Medusa* and Esther Vilar’s *The Manipulated Man* as well as an encyclopedia on how to live as a woman in the German Democratic Republic.
:   The audience was guided through the different rooms by the sound performance. There were moments of individual exploration and of collective gathering.
