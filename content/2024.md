#### **12.11.2024, [Dancing on Oblivion – »(un)learning bodies Symposium](https://www.akademie-solitude.de/en/event/unlearning-bodies-at-wuerttembergischer-kunstverein/), Württembergischer Kunstverein, Stuttgart, DE**

:   A poetic lecture by Jasmin Schädler and Joannie Baumgärtner
Dancing on Oblivion

Exploring on the whereabouts and lifespan of moments of unmonitored time in a present that is governed by datafied decisions, artists Jasmin Schädler and Joannie Baumgärtner engage in a poetic stream of consciousness to explore the temporal dissociation associated with dance floors and doom scrolling. They ponder, sing, sound, and swipe while being served by their feeders – content is flowing, eyes and ears overlap, layering, blending, challenging a linear perception of time.

#### **09. & 10.11.2024, [Memento Mori – INTERAKT Initiative](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCo6_2ZADa0/?img_index=1), Pragfreidhof Stuttgart, Stuttgart, DE**

INTERAKT presents “Memento Mori” (from Latin: “Remember Death”), an extraordinary participatory concert-mystery with a citizens' choir and professional musicians* at the Prague Cemetery in Stuttgart on All Saints' Day. The project explores the development of our perception of death through the language of music, focusing on music from the Middle Ages and the present day. In addition to traditional and liturgical death dance songs from the 11th to 16th centuries and excerpts from Hildegard von Bingen's “Ordo Virtutum”, original medieval songs from Italy, England, Spain and the Netherlands will be presented. The audience can also look forward to the world premiere of a contemporary work by multimedia composer Remmy Canedo, which deals with the burial rituals of the indigenous Selk'nam people from Chile, who died out in 1980. Even if the project does not offer an emotional processing of grief, it nevertheless creates space for reflection and new insights into the understanding of death as an integral part of life. At the same time, it invites us to celebrate life itself.

Supported by *Kulturamt der Stadt Stuttgart*, *Berthold-Leibinger Stiftung*, *GLS Stiftung* und *Aktion Mensch*.

#### **22.10.2024, [Narratives Embodied](https://lindenmuseum.de/narratives-embodied/), Wissenschaftsfestival, Linden-Museum, Stuttgart, DE**

:   The performance evening examines the inscription of narratives in bodies. In a re-appropriation, stories of Western dominant culture are overwritten. Whether through music as a representation of Brazilian pop culture or through the canon of European myths - the female body propagates new perspectives. A combined evening by Jasmin Schädler and Hanna Ulmer.  

:   Supported financially by *Freie Tanz- und Theater Szene Stuttgart* and *Kunststiftung BW*.

#### **25.&28.09.2024, Дядя Фантомас, [Заманбап искусство](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAnzutHoFVr/), Место — Действие Festival / ifa CCP Fellowship, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, KGZ**

:   Chyngyz's workshop is a laboratory of the collective “Zamanbap Art”, where Aidarov holds a leadership position. The collective works with the space of this house as a material for creativity, turning every corner of it into a theater stage. In addition to Chyngyz, Zamanbap Art includes artists Marat Raiymkulov @marat_raiymkulov and Emirlan Zhakshybaev .
The audience was invited to move around the house and garden to hear and see different scenes linking Chyngyz, his comrades and colleagues and the studio itself, which has become one of the places for informal meetings, exhibitions and film screenings of contemporary artists.

:   I was involved in this project as part of my ifa CCP Fellowship. I was supported the show as a performer and also helped to create the staging and the props.

:   Our paths begin in different places, but they find a common destination. Or perhaps it is not an end point, but rather a stopover - a place of refuge where we can all meet at eye level. Because this is where our paths have led us. Since February 24, 2022, around 151,000 refugees have arrived in the Baden-Württemberg region, around 32,000 of them in the state capital Stuttgart. Some of them will return home once the war is over, others have already made this city their new home.  

:   With “Echo of these days”, InterAKT presents an interactive installation that brings audio stories by author Kseniya Fuchs and images by five Ukrainian photographers into Stuttgart's public space. The project sensitively interweaves real experiences and fictional stories from Ukraine with the history of Stuttgart's Stadtgarten and creates space for shared encounters, exchange and reflection. Five stories, five protagonists, five palms, five photographers - all woven into the city's DNA and united in one historic location: the Stadtgarten Stuttgart. Through the artistic activation of the Stadtgarten, we cordially invite the local community as well as Ukrainian refugees and refugees of other nationalities to discover this place as a meeting point and place of exchange and to experience it from a new perspective. In German and Ukrainian language.   

:   Supported by the *Cultural Office of the City of Stuttgart*, the *Wüstenrot Foundation*, the *LBBW Foundation* and *Thieme Publishing House*.

#### **07.03-10.03.2024, [alles was schön ist – die apokalyptischen tänzerin\*nen](https://theaterrampe.de/event/alles-was-schoen-ist/), Theater RAMPE, Stuttgart, DE**

:   In ALLES WAS SCHÖN IST (ALL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL) we negotiate with relish the question of how we can think about social coexistence from the perspective of the beautiful experience without turning away from the crises and violence of the present. We ask ourselves what art would look like if the beautiful experience were at the center and thus attempt a practice of coping with the present.
The stage is filled with fog fronts that collide monumentally, physical sounds, flowing materials that make the bodies disappear, wind sensually across the floor, mud is produced and becomes a somatic extension, an excess. Voices pour out into sounds that are given space and time to develop into previously unheard sounds. In the field of tension between the pleasurable fulfillment of one's own performative desires and external expectations, a tensile test takes place.

:   We offer a space to experience beauty and celebrate beauty in a variety of ways.
More experiment than enlightenment!

:   ALLES WAS SCHÖN IST is the third and final part of die apokalyptischen tänzerin*nen's exploration of the triangular relationship between audience, performers and stage. The evening brings together the questions and insights from the first (PHASES OF THE RUPTURE) and second (THE MOST CONSUMABLE SHOW ON EARTH) parts and searches for a narrative for this decade of crises.

:   We offer a stage walk/tactile introduction and integrated audio description for all performances.
The spoken text will be shown on screens and there will be a contact person to assist with acoustic understanding.

:   ALLES WAS SCHÖN IST is a project by die apokalyptischen tänzerin\*nen in cooperation with Theater RAMPE. 
:   Funded by the Cultural Office of the City of Stuttgart, the accessibility funding program *Stuttgart für alle inklusiv* and  *Freie Tanz- und Theaterszene Stuttgart*. 
With the friendly support of *Produktionszentrum Tanz und Performance e. V.*.
