#### **25.10.2023, [Modes of Truth - Lecture Performance, Paratext No. 72](https://hangar.org/en/paratext/paratext-72/), Hangar.org, Barcelona, ES.**

:   The truth and nothing but the truth is the long-established foundation of Western culture. Although originally a form of oral contract, it has slowly evolved into an objective fact. Truth is a technology that has been perpetuating itself ever since, continuing to inscribe and overwrite others. The performance Modes of Truth unravels a narrative of truth along attributions and absurdities and spins them anew. A body and a lie detector become the medium of the polyphonic truth. 

:   The lecture performance was developed during the Baden-Württemberg – Catalonia residency, organised and funded by Kunststiftung BW, Goethe-Institut Barcelona and Hangor.Org.

#### **15./16.10.2023, [Truth to Nature – Installation, Open Studios](https://hangar.org/en/paratext/paratext-72/), Hangar.org, Barcelona, ES.**

:   Before objectivity, there was truth-to-nature.
Objectivity by Lorraine Daston & Peter Galison

:   This was a nature which operated as a metaphor for an ideal and rational society.
Urban Public Parks, 1840-1900: Design and Meaning by Hilary A. Taylorn

:   Encounters with local parks of Barcelona recorded in sounds and thoughts can be revisited in a multitextured plastic installation, mimiking the artificiality of parks that pretend to be nature or fulfill our expectations of this concept in the first place.

:   The booklet with all the text and some drawings can be found here:

#### **04.-19.08.2023, [Brandspuren](https://theaternatur.de/event/brandspuren-2/), Theaternatur Festival, Benneckenstein Oberharz am Brocken, DE**
:   You're standing in front of the fire station with your headphones on. People are all around you. The voice in your ear guides you further. The group starts moving, you in the middle of it. Where will the traces lead you?

The performative walk Brandspuren invites you on a journey into an alternative present, ranging from staged exceptional situations to dreamlike elements to an imagined future. In the process, a random community emerges that walks in the traces of fire and learns at least as much about human beings in the process.

:   Produced by THEATERNATUR Festival for performing arts.

#### **19.&20.07.2023, Vox Ex Nihilo, [InterAKT Initiative](https://interakt-initiative.com/), Theaterhaus Stuttgart, DE**
:   "Vox ex nihilo"\* (\*voice from nowhere) is an inclusive music, theatre and dance performance that questions the meaning of the voice from social, political and cultural perspectives and aims to make many different voices heard. It addresses the changes that the pandemic has had on social and cultural behaviour, particularly the limitations of the voice in a hearing society through the inevitable wearing of masks. The performance explores the political potential of the voice and relates to the protests in Belarus and the Russian-Ukrainian war. In collaboration with deaf performer Sabine Scherbel, it questions whether we can perceive and understand each other by making ourselves vulnerable. The performance creates a space for voice and silence and encourages a dialogue between different forms of communication to develop a better understanding of their meaning and possibilities. It is performed in German Sign Language and German Spoaken Language simultaneously.

#### **22.05.2023, [Gefährliche Körper](https://www.instagram.com/p/Csbe0Tkquks/), FAKI Festival, Zagreb, HR**
:   The duo *Frisch&Schick* ([Johannes Frick](https://www.instagram.com/jon_darc/) & Jasmin Schädler) presents the work Harmful Bodies - a promiscuous concert performance in cooperation with designer [Aziz Rebar](https://www.instagram.com/aziz_rebar/), media artist Timo Kleinemeier as well as make-up by [Luna Legend](https://www.instagram.com/luna.legend/). 
Harm emanates from our bodies, an awareness that has finally emerged in the last year. The artists devote themselves to love and promiscuity with emphasis on the physical harm. Since the discovery of the HI-Virus, this subject has been undergoing a social overhaul. From the fear of a death sentence at the time to today's classification of a chronic illness, the team encounters the history of a virus that knows no morals, but which has been and continues to be confronted in a moralizing and stigmatizing manner.
The audience is invited to a performative and musical journey that assumes different perspectives and aesthetic forms.

:   As part of the festival, an excerpt from the video work from 2021 was screened.

#### **01.03-30.04.2023, [Feuer und Flamme](https://www.fonds-daku.de/foerderung/foerder-ergebnisse/residenzen-nft-januar-2023/), #TakeHeart Residenz, Theater Rampe, Stuttgart, DE**

:   “Fire and Flame” is a performative research project on the subject of fire and on movements and narratives that are directly related to it. Fire has always shaped humanity and humanity shapes the world through fire. Fire is a means of emancipation, power, destruction and new beginnings, the performative potential of which is to be uncovered by the CyCy group (Livia Vogt & Jasmin Schädler).

:   Supported by Fonds Darstellende Künste with funds from the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and Media within the program NEUSTART KULTUR.
