# Jasmin Schädler

was born in Illertissen in 1989. After completing her bachelor’s degree in physics and cultural studies, she studied theater directing at the [Academy of Performing Arts Baden-Württemberg](https://adk-bw.de/) and completed her master’s degree in art praxis at the [Dutch Art Institute](https://dutchartinstitute.eu/) [(*Thesis: With a Human Face? - Aesthetics and Politics of Datafication*)](/de/thesis).  

The overarching subject of her work is the questioning of knowledge hierarchies. Coming from an intersectional perspective she investigates the relationship between space, perception and identity in both analog and digital. In doing so, she deals with data collection, reporting and the questioning of conventions of knowledge production.

She is a founding member of the performance collective [**die apokalyptischen tänzerin*nen**](https://www.apocalypse.dance), as well as a founding and board member of the association [**InterAKT Initiative e.V.**](https://www.interakt-initiative.com), which realizes music and performance projects in the Stuttgart area.
