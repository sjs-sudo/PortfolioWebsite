**28.11.2020, The possessed Gaze – a video call performanc, [Dance of Disorder Online Symposium](https://www.nonknowledge.org/disorder) HFBK Hamburg, DE**
:   We mirror, externalise, divide, lose ourselves. The leftovers are not considered human anymore. We call them data and feed them into frameworks we call machines or algorithms. But we cannot forget these remnants all together. Remorsefully we start to anthropomorphize their new shells. Suddenly we live among aliens we created but actually we are only looking at amputated parts of ourselves.
Are you looking at me?
Mark is possessed by Algorithma.
They look through his eyes at everyone else.
The stars watch from above, streaming ethereal power, acting upon their destiny.

:   With guest appearances by the singer [Angela Postweiler](https://angelapostweiler.de/) and students of HfBK Hamburg. The Symposium was curated by Annika Larsson & Isabel Gatzke.

**20.&21.11.2020, Sketched Fields, [Kunstraum 34](https://klangraum-stuttgart.de/?page_id=56) & [Radio Rampe](https://theaterrampe.de/stuecke/sketched-fields/), Stuttgart, DE**
:   For this show the car was approached as sound body, means of transportation and symbol for projections. A modified car was parked at various locations in public space in order to inscribe itself in the history of urban space, exposed to random observers. Apart from the installation a radio play was created: [Lava und Düsen](https://soundcloud.com/l_s_s_w/lava-und-duesen) (Lava and Nozzles), broadcast on November 21 via Radio Rampe. The play deals directly with the human connection and attachment to the sound of cars.

:   Together with [Perspektivenbox](http://www.perspektivenbox.com/) ([Ui-Kyung Lee](https://soundcloud.com/uikyung-lee) & [Julian Siffert](https://www.juliansiffert.com/)) und [Helen Weber](https://klasse-koch.de/Helen-Weber).
