#### **28.11.2020, The possessed Gaze – a video call performance, [Dance of Disorder Online Symposium](https://www.nonknowledge.org/disorder) HFBK Hamburg, DE**
:   We mirror, externalise, divide, lose ourselves. The leftovers are not considered human anymore. We call them data and feed them into frameworks we call machines or algorithms. But we cannot forget these remnants all together. Remorsefully we start to anthropomorphize their new shells. Suddenly we live among aliens we created but actually we are only looking at amputated parts of ourselves.
Are you looking at me?
Mark is possessed by Algorithma.
They look through his eyes at everyone else.
The stars watch from above, streaming ethereal power, acting upon their destiny.

&nbsp;

:   With guest appearances by the singer [Angela Postweiler](https://angelapostweiler.de/) and students of HfBK Hamburg. 
The Dance of Disorder Online Symposium was curated by Annika Larsson & Isabel Gatzke.

#### 20.& 21.11.2020, Sketched Fields, [Kunstraum 34](https://klangraum-stuttgart.de/?page_id=56) & [Radio Rampe](https://theaterrampe.de/stuecke/sketched-fields/), Stuttgart, DE
:   For this show the car was approached as sound body, means of transportation and symbol for projections. A modified car was parked at various locations in public space in order to inscribe itself in the history of urban space, exposed to random observers. Apart from the installation a radio play was created: [Lava und Düsen](https://soundcloud.com/l_s_s_w/lava-und-duesen) (Lava and Nozzles), broadcast on November 21 via Radio Rampe. The play deals directly with the human connection and attachment to the sound of cars.

&nbsp;

:   Together with [Perspektivenbox](http://www.perspektivenbox.com/) ([Ui-Kyung Lee](https://soundcloud.com/uikyung-lee)&[Julian Siffert](https://www.juliansiffert.com/)) und [Helen Weber](https://klasse-koch.de/Helen-Weber).

#### **07.-10.11.2020, vom Aufgang der Sonne, [Kunstverein Wagenhalle](http://kunstverein-wagenhalle.de/), Stuttgart, DE**
:   We locate ourselves in the so-called West and at the same time in the center of most map views of the world. According to Hegel, not only does the sun set here, "Europe is par excellence the end of world history" (Lectures on the Philosophy of World History, 1837). Hegel, who is still a point of reference for a variety of philosophical approaches today, not only left a lasting mark on this perspective, but also stereotyped it. "vom Aufgang der Sonne" interrogates this localization and invites to hear other voices. n.n.n. collective questions in their work both the philosopher and his reception especially in the context of the Haitian Revolution, as well as through the practice of cartography. For the latter, they collaborate with Sasha Engelmann and Sophie Dyer's [open-weather](https://open-weather.community/) project, among others. An accompanying publication will be released in spring 2021, designed by [HuM Collective](https://hum-co.de/).

#### **14.05.2020, [Mit Haiti an der Hegel-Bar](https://www.mithaitianderhegelbar.de), Zoom Symposium, DE**
:   The event was moved from the original venue, the bar Rakete at Theater Rampe to virtual bars due to pandemic.
Hegel's 250th birthday is not only an occasion to reflect on the achievements of continental philosophy, but also an important chance to give a platform to voices that were suppressed by European Enlightenment. Misanthropic categorizations established by the Enlightenment are still reproduced today in the uncritical reading of the philosophy of the period and the lack of interrogation of historiography. Together with the guests of the symposium, the audience is invited to interrogate these discourses and to highlight other perspectives following the example of the Haitian Revolution.

&nbsp;

:   **Dr. Jeanette Ehrmann** (Political Theory and History of Political Thought)
